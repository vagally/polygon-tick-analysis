# polygon-tick-analysis
Simple Python code to download and print Polygon.io stock tick data

Python client for the [Polygon.io API](https://polygon.io).

## Requirements
Requires Python >= 3.8 and a Polygon.IO subscription. For tick data you need the Developer License.
I also use the MatLab PY plot library.

## Background
I found a Tiktoker (@20_minute_trader) who was promoting a reliable pattern in a short window of time. I wanted to validate his claims, thus this project was born.

## Getting started
To get started, copy this file to your own Jupyter Notebook and make the edits and off you go.  This is very simple python, and can be optimized for sure.  But I liked how quickly I was able to go from zero to done.

## Required Inputs
* API key
* begin time = GTE
* end time = LTE
* stock list -- up to you.


Enjoy and let me know if you have any questions.
